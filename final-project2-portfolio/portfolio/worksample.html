  <p>This is an animation created with Modern HTML5 and JavaScript web techniques. It was created as an opener for the client&rsquo;s new website (which, at this writing, is still preparing to launch).</p>
    <p>I worked very closely with the designer, who created the concept and artwork, and with the client. The animation needed to emulate the motion abilities of Flash but still be readable in modern devices, which Flash cannot do.
    <br>I used several Adobe programs including Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator, and Edge Animate to complete the animation. I eventually chose to use Adobe Edge Animate, because of its ability to create the complex animation techniques the client desired. A considerable amount optimization was necessary on the detailed images, many of which are transparent. The big challenge was to keep the site load-time to a minimum, as transparent images with complex gradients can be very large, and would otherwise tend to "drag" the animation load time.<br>

<p>This whimsical site was created for a photographer who offers a "photo booth" service to events and parties. This design mimics the idea of the old-fashioned photo-booth strips, and utilizes modern CSS and Javascript techniques to showcase some of the photographer&rsquo;s fun shots.<br>This photographer has a need to showcase the results of the photo booth events in order to show other prospective clients what kinds of photos they might expect. There are many &ldquo;slide show&rdquo; templates that we explored for his site, but none really meet the needs. This particular solution is great in the way that it scrolls, and yet is completely responsive, and will adjust the layout and image size to adapt to all kinds of devices.<br>
This example shows the great care that went into decisions about color, text, and presentation, as well as showing a proficiency with cutting edge web encoding skills. CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript in particular. </p>

<p>I created this on-screen calculator using only code. Using JavaScript, I was able to make the widget calculate almost anything a normal handheld calculator could. 
<br>
This showcases my skill at using CSS to precision design (There were NO images or graphics added to create this design), as well as JavaScript skills. The JavaScript challenge was getting the code to do just what you want it to, including the trick of getting the keys on the keyboard to "hook" into the action of the calculator.

<p>This site was built completely from scratch using advanced CSS and HTML techniques. To create the catalog page in this site I wrote an XML data file from scratch, and used Spry datasets to interactively populate the catalog items. The updates can be conveniently made for the client with just editing the XML file (adding and changing products, prices, sizes, etc.) without having to get into the HTML.</p>
<p>This site showcases three different forms: <a href="http://student.santarosa.edu/%7Ejclark2/efolio/portfolio/clients/haveDecals/order.html">One for ordering from the catalog</a>; one for <a href="http://student.santarosa.edu/%7Ejclark2/efolio/portfolio/clients/haveDecals/custom.html">submitting a custom order</a>, and one for signing up to receive information about the <a href="http://student.santarosa.edu/%7Ejclark2/efolio/portfolio/clients/haveDecals/traveling.html">location of the traveling shop</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
<p>This WordPress site was created for Double Punches Boxing Club, a non-profit program for youth in Santa Rosa. They needed to be able to manage their content without knowing a lot about web design and code. In a small team of students, I created  this site to the client&rsquo;s specifications.
<br>The client had an existing logo, which was pretty much an ink drawing they had been photocopying, and they asked me to redo the logo making a clean, digital version that was close to the original.
<br>I created a WordPress Child Theme for this site so that updates won't destroy the work that went into its creations.<br>The client's demands were challenging in that they wanted a mix of features that aren't part of one simple WordPress template, so we had to do alter the child theme quite a bit to include drop down menus, a slide show header, and other features that required some experience with plug-ins and PHP code.
