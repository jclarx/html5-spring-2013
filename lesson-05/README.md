SRJC CS50.12 Section 5371

Inside this directory (lesson-05) are the files for the animation sequence I am working on with a colleague.
The online versions can be viewed at http://joanclark.net/animation_tests/index.php
At the time of committing these files, the animation is in a state of need... We are working to minimize the images sizes and to remove some of the layers that seem to be contributing to slow upload time and an undesired herky-jerky motion.
